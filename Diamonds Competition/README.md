- The goal of this competition was to predict the prices of a fictional diamond dataset. Our approach began with comprehensive data exploration and visualization, employing both bivariate and multivariate analysis techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the data. We then proceeded with data cleaning and preprocessing, employing various transformations to enhance the quality of the dataset. To streamline this process, we developed a preprocessing pipeline that included column transformers and custom transformers to replicate the steps taken during data preprocessing.

- Next, we experimented with different machine learning models to predict the diamond prices. Through rigorous testing, we discovered that boosting models consistently yielded superior results. Encouraged by these findings, we fine-tuned our models and incorporated them into a final pipeline to predict the prices of the test data. This optimization significantly enhanced the performance of our pipeline.

- As a result of our efforts, we achieved a commendable position within the top 10 among 70 teams participating in the competition. Our diligent data exploration, preprocessing, model selection, and pipeline refinement contributed to our success in accurately predicting the prices of the diamond dataset.
